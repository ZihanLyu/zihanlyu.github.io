# Our Project is About:
We created a **task management website**, allowing users to write down their tasks in different sections. We want to create a natural and accessible digital experience that improves efficiency by allowing users to interact with tasks in a more intuitive way.
# How We Separate the Work:
Zihan worked on the login and admin page functions including PHP, JS, CSS and HTML. Yijing worked on the history and index page. We worked together to figure out how each task should look like. Zihan implemented add task function. Yijing implemented add section function and Javascript animation. Zihan worked on debugging and make the home page looked nicer and easier to understand. 
# How to Use Our Website:
## Index Page
There is a short introduction explaining what our website is about. In the top left corner, you will find two icons:

## Login Page
Click on **"User Login"** â€” a window will pop up.

- **First-time users** will be registered automatically.
- By clicking the **"+"** sign, users can select an avatar.

You will be redirected to the **Welcome Page**.

## Welcome Page
The Welcome Page will display your selected avatar, your username, and the message:
