# Our Project is About:
We created a **task management website**, allowing users to write down their tasks in different sections. We want to create a natural and accessible digital experience that improves efficiency by allowing users to interact with tasks in a more intuitive way.
# How We Separate the Work:
Zihan worked on the login and admin page functions including PHP, JS, CSS and HTML. Yijing worked on the history and index page. We worked together to figure out how each task should look like. Zihan implemented add task function. Yijing implemented add section function and Javascript animation. Zihan worked on debugging and make the home page looked nicer and easier to understand.
